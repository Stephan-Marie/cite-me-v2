# CiteMe Web App Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the step-by-step approach for building the CiteMe web application, a tool designed to help users generate properly formatted citations for academic and professional documents. The app will leverage client-side processing for text comparison and the OpenAI API for citation formatting.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### 1. Project Setup & Architecture
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up Next.js + TypeScript project structure
  - Configure build system and development environment
  - Establish coding standards and conventions
  - Create initial GitHub repository
- **Rationale:** Starting with a solid foundation ensures consistency across the development lifecycle and sets up scalable architecture for future enhancements.

### 2. Core UI Framework
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement responsive layout framework
  - Design component library system
  - Create dark/light mode support
  - Build navigation structure
- **Rationale:** Establishing the UI framework early allows for consistent styling throughout development and enables rapid implementation of features with consistent styling.

### 3. PDF Processing Functionality
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate pdf.js for client-side PDF extraction
  - Create text extraction utilities
  - Implement metadata parsing
  - Add content chunking mechanisms for efficient processing
- **Rationale:** PDF processing is a core functionality and establishing this capability early enables all subsequent comparison and citation features to be built on this foundation.

## Phase 2: Text Comparison Engine (Weeks 3-4)

### 4. Text Comparison Implementation
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate Fuse.js for fuzzy matching
  - Create comparison algorithms and scoring system
  - Implement text chunking for performance optimization
  - Build basic matching interface
- **Rationale:** The text comparison engine is critical for identifying which portions of text require citations, and must be implemented client-side to minimize API usage costs.

### 5. Web Worker Integration
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up web worker architecture for parallel processing
  - Implement worker pool management
  - Create task distribution system
  - Add progress tracking for long-running comparisons
- **Rationale:** Web workers enable parallel processing without blocking the UI thread, essential for processing large documents without impacting user experience.

### 6. Storage Implementation
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up IndexedDB for processed text storage
  - Implement caching strategies
  - Create data persistence layer
  - Add session recovery mechanisms
- **Rationale:** Proper storage implementation prevents redundant processing and improves performance by caching results.

## Phase 3: OpenAI Integration (Weeks 5-6)

### 7. Citation API Integration
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement OpenAI API client
  - Create citation formatting prompts
  - Build response validation and error handling
  - Develop citation style templates
- **Rationale:** The OpenAI integration is essential for generating properly formatted citations according to various academic styles.

### 8. Request Optimization
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement batching of similar citation requests
  - Create priority queue system
  - Add rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
  - Build smart caching of citation results
- **Rationale:** Optimizing API requests is crucial for minimizing costs and ensuring the app remains free to use while maintaining performance.

### 9. Citation Style Implementation
- **Tasks:**
  - Create templates for all supported citation styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, OSCOLA, IEEE, AMA)
  - Implement style selection UI
  - Build preview functionality for formatted citations
  - Add bibliography generation based on citation style
- **Rationale:** Supporting multiple citation styles is a key requirement and differentiator for the application.

## Phase 4: User Interface Enhancement (Weeks 7-8)

### 10. File Upload Interface
- **Tasks:**
  - Create drag-and-drop upload areas
  - Implement file validation
  - Add progress indicators for uploads
  - Build reference file management interface
- **Rationale:** A clean, intuitive upload interface is critical for user adoption and satisfaction.

### 11. Rich Text Editor Integration
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate TinyMCE for editing
  - Implement citation insertion functionality
  - Add bibliography management
  - Create export options
- **Rationale:** A rich text editor enables users to review and modify generated citations before exporting their work.

### 12. Results Visualization
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement react-window for virtualized rendering
  - Create matched text highlighting
  - Build similarity score visualization
  - Add citation confidence indicators
- **Rationale:** Effective visualization helps users understand and verify the application's results.

## Phase 5: Performance Optimization & Testing (Weeks 9-10)

### 13. Performance Tuning
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement progressive loading for large documents
  - Optimize web worker distribution
  - Fine-tune comparison algorithms
  - Add memory management optimizations
- **Rationale:** Performance optimization ensures the application remains responsive even with large documents and complex comparisons.

### 14. Comprehensive Testing
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement unit tests for core functionality
  - Create integration tests for key user flows
  - Perform browser compatibility testing
  - Conduct performance benchmarking
- **Rationale:** Thorough testing ensures reliability and identifies potential issues before release.

### 15. Error Handling & Recovery
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Create user-friendly error messages
  - Add automatic retry mechanisms
  - Build session recovery options
- **Rationale:** Robust error handling improves user experience by gracefully handling unexpected situations.

## Phase 6: Launch Preparation (Weeks 11-12)

### 16. Documentation
- **Tasks:**
  - Create user documentation
  - Write developer documentation
  - Add inline help and tooltips
  - Prepare API usage guidelines
- **Rationale:** Good documentation helps users understand how to use the application effectively.

### 17. Final Polish
- **Tasks:**
  - Conduct usability testing
  - Refine UI based on feedback
  - Optimize for accessibility
  - Perform final performance tuning
- **Rationale:** Final polish ensures the application meets user expectations and provides a positive experience.

### 18. Deployment Setup
- **Tasks:**
  - Configure production environment
  - Set up monitoring and analytics
  - Implement usage tracking
  - Prepare launch plan
- **Rationale:** Proper deployment setup ensures a smooth launch and enables monitoring of application performance.

## Future Enhancements (Post-Launch)

### Potential Future Features
- DOCX file support
- Enhanced matching algorithms
- Collaborative editing features
- Extended offline capabilities
- API usage analytics
- Bulk citation processing
